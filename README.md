# Hello!

Seven interactive pieces (3 types: flood fill, trailing eyes, articulated) of Charlotte Silverman's work

god i would have changed a lot of this but simply there is only so much time

everything is in index.json, index.html, data.json, and the assets folder

"Playing Around" directory is where I put all the code I used for testing - they won't work unless you reroute the urls
